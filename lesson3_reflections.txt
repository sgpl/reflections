When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When others want to work on it / are working on it / when I want to have it accessible from other places. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For better control. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a copy of someone's repo on github. clone is a copy of the repo on a local machine or on github. branches are a way of checking out a version of the project and working on it separately from the main snapshot of the project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
